## Author

My name is Sebastian Silbermann. One of my earlier nicknames was _Silberfuchs_ which
is German for _Silverfox_. Since there are plenty of websites using this name I
thought about something similar and discovered by accident that _Solverfox_ is actually
quite fitting as well since I like solving problems.

## Stack used

The [source is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/eps1lon/solverfox.dev) so you can see every package I rely on.

The page itself is powered by [sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) which is a page-framework using [svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
Since I'm mostly doing [react](https://reactjs.org/) you'll occasionally see some react trees inside the
page.
